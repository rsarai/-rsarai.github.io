- [Gall's Law](https://matt-rickard.com/galls-law/)
    - Simple system evolve to become complex one. A system that starts complex rarely works.


- [Ignore Sunk Costs](https://matt-rickard.com/ignore-sunk-costs/)
    - Don't be overly attached to things you already paid.

- [The impact of less scalable work.](https://lethain.com/less-scalable-work/)
    - When working on one of my first project I remember a advice we got from an expirienced dev: "Do things that don't scale. We are small, let's take advantage". Reading this post was a reminder.

- Conti Ransomware Group Diaries Series
    - [Part I: Evasion](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/03/conti-ransomware-group-diaries-part-i-evasion/)
    - [Part II: The Office](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/03/conti-ransomware-group-diaries-part-ii-the-office/)
    - [Part III: Weaponry](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/03/conti-ransomware-group-diaries-part-iii-weaponry/)

- [Latency Numbers You Should Know](https://matt-rickard.com/latency-numbers-you-should-know-2022/)
    - This post highlights my lack of understanding and creates the perception that I need to study more.

- [Contributing to Complex Projects](https://mitchellh.com/writing/contributing-to-complex-projects)
    - A good read, I have been working with complex projects and the post reflects how I approach new projects. It also inspired to write about other non-technical aspects for my organization.
