One of my main focus in 2020 (besides my paying job) was to experiment how a academic life would be. My goal was to gather as much information as possible to decide if this would be a path to explore in the future. Here's the article I published so far:

1. Caldas, R., <span style="color: #00fff5">Sarai, R.</span>, de Lima Neto, F. B., & Markert, B. (2020). Validation of two hybrid approaches for clustering age-related groups based on gait kinematics data. _Medical Engineering & Physics, 78_, 90-97.
