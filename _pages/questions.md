title: Active Recall Questions
permalink: /questions/
---
Congrats, you found this page! This is my set of study questions, I try to test myself on subjects I want to remember with a interleaved and varied practice. Beware that some links may be broken.


> When learning is hard, you’re doing important work.

> <cite>Make It Stick</cite>

Researches show that re-reading, note taking, and cramming are not effective study techniques. What really makes things stick is being actively engaged with the content; therefore the list of questions.

> Repeated effortful recall or practice helps integrate learning into mental models&#x2026; When practice conditions are varied or retrieval is interleaved with the practice of other material, we increase our abilities of discrimination and induction and the versatility with which we can apply the learning in new settings at a later date.
