Science is at its best when it doesn't trust itself&#x2026; Let's end with the quote attributed to statistician George Box, 'All models are wrong, but some are useful'. Science gives us ways to understand the world and we need to both trust in the science but know the limitations of what it has to say." - [Trusting Scientists, Computational Complexity](https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/08/trusting-scientists.html)

> "The way you motivate someone who doesn’t need the money is the same way you should motivate people who do need the money: by giving them meaningful roles with real responsibility where they can see how their efforts contribute to a larger whole, giving them an appropriate amount of ownership over their work and input into decisions that involve that work, providing useful feedback, recognizing their contributions, helping them feel they’re making progress toward things that matter to them, and — importantly — not doing things that de-motivate people (like yelling or constantly shifting goals or generally being a jerk)." - [Alison Green (Ask a Manager)](https://www.askamanager.org/2021/08/how-do-i-manage-an-employee-who-doesnt-need-the-job.html)
