Hi, I'm Rebeca ðŸ™‹

By day, I work as a software developer at [Vinta Software](https://vinta.com.br). By night, I'm a master's student in the field of Artificial Intelligence at the [University of Pernambuco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pernambuco).


### Research
My research today focuses on how to use machine learning to solve problems and improve people's quality of life. I work with gait signals to early detect signals of neurodegenerative diseases. I'm also interested in data privacy and fairness.

### Work
I work as a Software Engineer at Vinta Software, we are a software studio based in Brazil. In the past, I've worked building and scaling web applications, but now my work is to build a reliable structure to the execution of machine learning pipelines.

### Personal
For fun, I like to ride my motorcycle, watch some surf, and follow my home football [team](https://www.instagram.com/nauticope/)âš½ðŸ‡µðŸ‡ª. I also read lots of books and curse some people related to politics on twitter.
