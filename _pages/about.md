Hi, I'm Rebeca ðŸ™‹

### Work
I work as a Software Engineer at Vinta Software, we are a software studio based in Brazil. In the past, I've worked building and scaling web applications, but now my work is to build a reliable structure to the execution of machine learning pipelines.

### Personal
For fun, I like to ride my motorcycle, watch surf competitions, and follow my hometown football [team](https://www.instagram.com/nauticope/)âš½ðŸ‡µðŸ‡ª. I play the piano more days than not, read books and curse some people related to brazilian politics on twitter.
